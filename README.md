A.Background
Watching movies in theaters is one of the entertainment activities that is favored by various groups. Along with the development of technology and changes in people's lifestyles, the need for access to movie information and practical ticket booking is increasing. Many people now want the convenience of seeing movie schedules, choosing seats, and buying tickets without having to come directly to the cinema. Seeing this phenomenon, our group took the initiative to develop a movie theater application that can meet these needs. This application is designed to provide quick and easy access for users to find information about movies, showtimes, movie theater locations, and to book tickets online. With this application, we hope to increase the convenience and efficiency of the movie-going experience for the community.

B.Objective 
The purpose of developing this movie theater application is to provide convenience to users in accessing movie-related information, such as showtimes, movie theater locations, and ticket availability. In addition, this application aims to simplify the ticket booking process with a fast and practical online system, so that users no longer need to queue at the counter. This application is also expected to improve the user experience in planning a visit to the cinema through easy-to-use features.
